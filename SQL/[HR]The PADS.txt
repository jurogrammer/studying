Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.



sol)
SELECT CONCAT(Name,"(",LEFT(Occupation,1),")")
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY Name;

SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ',COUNT(Occupation),' ',LOWER(Occupation),'s.')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation) ASC , Occupation ASC;


GROUP BY는 언제 쓰는가?
-> 어떤 집단 별로 값을 보고 싶을 때.
    일반적으로는 행별로 처리함.
    위와 같은 경우 Occupation 별로 값을 보고 싶었기 때문에 group by 수행.

LOWER -> 소문자로
COUNT -> 해당 집단 수 세기
